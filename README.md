# Some Code From Long Ago.

Java has been around a long time, and this code proves that point.

Take a look at each class, see how they are linked. They are not all linked together, but each class has something
useful for you find.

### Scrabble

Take a look at how a case statement is used instead of a whole lot of
IF statements. Kind of cool, huh?

### Loops

#### Squares, TriangleOne, & TriangleTwo

Dig around and look at how loops are used, even a nested loop or three.
Play around with different parametera to the functions. Run a few.

### Calendar

Look at how the logic allows for various calendar operations. Much of this
you can rely on the Java standard library to use, but the ideas here are good to
look at and try to follow. 

Run CalendarGraphic, and step through the code used to create the simple window. It uses Java's older AWT library, but does show a little bit of how to display in a window.

### Account

Notice how we create an Account object and subclass it in DepositAccount. 
What does the exception do? why does this seem like a good idea?

### TextIO

Read through this class, carefully. See how the developer is trying to simplify Java
IO? Do what you find there.

### Lab Goals

Write tests for many of these classes (leave OUT TextIO). The more you do, the more points you get.
